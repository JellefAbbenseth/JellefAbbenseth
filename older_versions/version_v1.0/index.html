              <h3>SchoolProject - Studyprogram</h3>
              <p>
                Study-program is a project, which is part of my curriculum.
              </p>
              <p>
                It‚Äôs a school project which was made during a special class over a time of eight weeks. The subject was freely selectable. The purpose of my project was to write a program which can automatically produce mathematical exercises. These exercises are adjusted to the knowledge of the user.
              </p>
              <p>
                The languages used were Python, HTML and CSS. Flask and sqlite3 are modules which linked the user interfaces, the program, and the database. Key components of the project are the program itself, the project- and customer documentation together with a final presentation.
              </p>
              <p>
                During this project I was able to learn how I can link different systems, like graphical user-interfaces, the program, and databases, together. Furthermore, I could improve my experience with planning, design, and development of a project.

              <h3>GrowthV2</h3>
              <p>
                GrowthV2 is a small text-based role-playing game with a graphical user interface.
              </p>
              <p>
                It was created as a private project in reference to the standards for my classes. The purpose of my project was to make a project from the idea to the completed product to make my first experiences with programming and user interfaces.
              </p>
              <p>
                The languages used were Java and Java.swing to make the graphical user interface. Key components of the project are the program itself and the project- and customer documentation. There‚Äôs also a small Gantt-diagram to show the different steps.
              </p>
              <p>
                During this project I was able to learn more about project organisation and made my first experiences with Interfaces.

              <h3>Growth</h3>
              <p>
                Growth is a small text-based role-playing game.
              </p>
              <p>
                It‚Äôs my first small program which I made on my own. The purpose was to get used to using different classes and methods to reduce program parts which recur often.
              </p>
              <p>
                The language used was Java without any modules. The user would be able to play by writing different keywords in the terminal, those keywords were given through the output of texts.
              </p>
              <p>
                During this project I was able to learn more about the process of writing my own small programs.

              <h3>Website</h3>
              <p>
                My website, to give a small overview over my projects.
              </p>
              <p>
                I created this website to give some information about projects I made until today. The purpose is to give an easy and fast overview over my skills and skills.
              </p>
              <p>
                The languages used were HTML and CSS. The website has a certain flexibility, those are enabled through Flex and Media Queries.
              </p>
              <p>
                During this project I was able to learn more about the usage of these languages, which I got to know during classes.
